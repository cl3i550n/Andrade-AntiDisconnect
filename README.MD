## Overview

This feature is designed to enhance the player's experience in online games by automatically managing what happens when the internet connection is lost or re-established. It utilizes a series of in-game actions to ensure that the game's state and gameplay remain stable and secure during internet interruptions, as well as when the connection is recovered.

## How It Works

### When the Internet is Disconnected

- **Control Lockdown**: As soon as the internet connection is lost, the feature automatically locks various player controls to prevent undesired actions. This includes basic movements, attacks, shooting, and the ability to enter or exit vehicles.

- **User Interface**: An interface (NUI - New User Interface) is displayed on the screen to inform the player about the loss of connection, keeping them informed about the current state.

### When the Internet is Reconnected

- **Control Unlock**: Upon re-establishing the connection, the feature reverses the previous actions, unlocking the controls and allowing the player to resume their in-game activities without interruption.

- **Interface Removal**: The interface that was displayed during the disconnection is removed, returning the game screen to its normal state.

## Benefits

- **Stability**: Helps maintain game stability during internet connection fluctuations.
- **Security**: Prevents the player try dumps situations within the game due to a lost connection.
- **Information**: Keeps the player informed about the status of their connection, enhancing the gaming experience.
